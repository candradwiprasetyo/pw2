						I’ve just finished reading The Mobile Book, put together by the very talented guys from Smashing Magazine, and I’m pleased to say that I thought it was an interesting and informative read.

I was kindly sent a copy of the book to review, just a week ago, and during that week I’ve been able to brush up on my responsive design skills and also learn a few new ideas too.

I’ve done a fair bit of reading about responsive design in the past, and I’ve designed and built for mobile before too, so I already knew the basics. This book basically brings all the latest mobile design ideas together into one place. It helped me organise my thoughts on design for mobile and get a good high level view of responsive design best practices.

If you know nothing at all about responsive design, The Mobile Book will give you a strong foundation. For those of you with a bit more experience, you might learn a few things you didn’t know.

So let’s have a look at this book in a bit more detail. It’s 337 pages and broken up into 3 main sections:

    The Mobile Landscape
    Responsive Web Design
    UX Design for Mobile

I’ll give you a brief overview of what to expect in each section below.
The Mobile Landscape

The book begins with a chapter about the current state of mobile web design written by Peter-Paul Koch. He looks at the history of mobile browsers, mobile phones and how the mobile revolution came to be.

Following on from this, Stephanie Reiger gives us some valuable insights into the future of mobile web design. She explores the idea that one day everything will be connected and looks into the emerging technology that will shape the future of the mobile web.

To be honest, this wasn’t my favourite section of the book as I’m much more interested in the practical side of mobile design than hearing about mobile design history or future predictions. That being said, it was good to get some background theory on the mobile design space, now and in the future.
